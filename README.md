**Assignment: Collaborative Content Contribution**

**Objective:** To create a collaborative webpage where students can contribute content to be displayed below a navigation bar. This assignment will help students practice Git and GitHub collaboration while working on a simple web project.

**Instructions:**

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Each student should start by forking the original project repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the project in their GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository:**
   - After forking, each student should clone their forked repository to their local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   - In their local repository, students should create a new branch with a descriptive name for their contribution.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-content
   ```

4. **Add Content:**
   - Students should add their content in HTML format below the navigation bar in the `index.html` file. The content can be a paragraph about a specific topic, their favorite hobby, or any appropriate text.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   - After adding content, students should commit their changes with a meaningful commit message.

   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add content about [topic]"
   ```

6. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push the changes to their forked repository on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-content
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
   - On GitHub, students should navigate to their forked repository and create a Pull Request to merge their changes into the original project repository.

8. **Review and Merge:**
   - As the instructor or project maintainer, review the Pull Requests submitted by students. If the content is appropriate, merge their contributions into the main branch of the original repository.

9. **Feedback and Collaboration:**
   - Encourage students to review and provide feedback on each other's contributions by commenting on the Pull Requests.

**Grading Criteria:**

- Completeness and correctness of the added content.
- Proper use of Git and GitHub for forking, branching, and creating Pull Requests.
- Collaboration and constructive feedback on peers' contributions.

**Deadline:** Set a specific deadline for students to complete this assignment and submit their Pull Requests.

This assignment will not only help students learn about Git and GitHub but also allow them to collaborate on a web project, enhancing their HTML and version control skills.
