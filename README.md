**Assignment: Collaborative Content Contribution**

**Objective:** To create a collaborative webpage where students can contribute content to be displayed below a navigation bar. This assignment will help students practice Git and GitHub collaboration while working on a simple web project.

**Instructions:**

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Each student should start by forking the original project repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the project in their GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository:**
   - After forking, each student should clone their forked repository to their local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/denyzabra/Exercise1
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   - In their local repository, students should create a new branch with a descriptive name for their contribution.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/slider
   ```

4. **Add Content:**
   - Students should add their content in HTML format below the navigation bar in the `index.html` file. The content can be a paragraph about a specific topic, their favorite hobby, or any appropriate text.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   - After adding content, students should commit their changes with a meaningful commit message.

   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Added slider below the navigationn bar"
   ```

6. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push the changes to their forked repository on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/added slider below the navigation 
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
   - On GitHub, students should navigate to their forked repository and create a Pull Request to merge their changes into the original project repository.

8. **Review and Merge:**
   - As the instructor or project maintainer, review the Pull Requests submitted by students. If the content is appropriate, merge their contributions into the main branch of the original repository.

9. **Feedback and Collaboration:**
   - Encourage students to review and provide feedback on each other's contributions by commenting on the Pull Requests.
